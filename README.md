# Pig_Game
<ul>
  <li>Two players take turns playing in rounds</li>
  <li>In a round, the player rolls a single die as many times as they wish, with the sum of their results becoming their score for that round.</li>
  <li>If the player rolls a 1, then their score for that round goes to 0 and the other player takes a turn.</li>
  <li>At any point in time, the current play may choose to hold, which adds their round score to their total score, and play passes to the other player</li>
  <li>The first player whose total score reaches 100 wins the game</li>
</ul>
